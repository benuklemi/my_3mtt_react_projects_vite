# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Fatch and Displaying List with API

Fetching data from an API using fetch or axios, storing it in state with useState, and managing lifecycle with useEffect. It emphasizes proper loading and error handling.

Creating a reusable ListComponent that accepts an array of items as props and renders each item dynamically, supporting customization through props.

Rendering the list in a parent component by passing in the fetched data, showing a loading indicator, and displaying error messages when needed.

âœ… Requirements include:

React functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect)

Reusable, dynamic components

Semantic HTML (<ul>, <li>, <div>)

Handling edge cases like empty data or API errors
